This species has been knoun to me for a long time, but was considered as
Lastrea liyulata J. Sm. It is described here from the most common form—that
is, rather snia-ll specimens-ualthough sometimes it attains a size three times
as large as is indicated in the diagnosis, and even larger. The plant 0311 always
be readily distinguished from Ι). «immersa and D. Ziyulata (which to me are not
specifically distinct) by its very sharp segments, which are cuneate and decurrent,
and by its light green color and more firm texture. Its affinity is with D.
Koordersii ChristS of Celebes, but that species is distinguishable by its very
peculiar indusium which Ι have described as follows: “Indusio subgloboso lateral-
iter inhaerente duro crustato valde convexo brunneo nitido adiaphano sorum
margine deflexo (more M atom'oe) tegente.''
