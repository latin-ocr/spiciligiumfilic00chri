lii'zox. l'rovinec of Rizal, Rosoboso (08 1¹‘0oewo'rlhm January, 1900.
Small, very narrow and very simple in comparison with the type, but closely
related by the shoots developed along· the upper parts of the leaves.

Var. inconstans (Copel. in Govt. Lab. Publ. 28 (1905) 43 pro specie).

ln view of the fact that two varieties show a progressive intergradation
between the type. and the speeies described by (Jopelsmd, 1 have not hesitated to
wnsider the latter as a variety of Leptochil-us ἠρίον-06111113, a form still inore
reduced than thc preceding, characterized by its very small size, the apices of the
leaves often linear, the shoots very irregular. Var. Fooeworthyi is almost exactly
intermediate between the type and the variety inconstans.

This variety seems to he. rather widely distributed in the PhiIippines, I have
specimens from Christmas Island (Straits Settlements) leg. Ridley that closely
approach it.

Var. Linnaeanus (Fee Acrost. 87 pro specie).

1 believe that this form ean be reduced, with a sufficient ‹leg-ree of surety, as
a variety of Leptooh‘ilus heteroczritus, as a derived form of that species, in spite
of its uniformly elongated and very narrow leaves. Its texture, its nerveS,
although strongly simplified, its proliferous leaves and the strong resemblance
of its ofl‘shoots to those of the normal form support this contention. We have
then a series almost complete from the. type, that seems to be always triphyllous
in the Philippines, to the form with absolutely linear and undivided leaves.

This is the plant that 1 have previously considered as Aspidium Fauriei var.
clatum Christ,5 and which copelaml, MSS„ referred to Nephrodium. Makino⁰
treats it with reason under Athyrium. After an examination of abundant material
I have divided this species into several, the representative in the Philippines
being A. aorisopraron, a species of a Uhinese group already known from Yunnan,
