PHILIPPINE srnoms oF DRYOPTERIS. 191

Leptoehzflus, Gymnopterz's, Polybotrya-, Eyenolfia, Stenosemia.. and an-
nopterc‘s with Aspulizm, in a broad sense, appears to me to acquire a new
support; and what is 111010, although perhaps in the cases where it 11115
1101 yet been possible. to find the aspidioid type 01 1111 001051101101(1 11101115,
11 15 111011111110 that the aspidioid type has 1101 110011 preserved or that it
has been 50 modified as 10 110 unreeognizable. Be that as it may,
for Stenosemz'a one must admit the immediate des-cent 01 Pleocnemirz
1110111111-1111110110, (Πιῖσΐῃομΐθνίε chattayramiea, Clarke) as Reclclome has
asserted.3 Likewise 1 now connect my Gymnoplvris Bona· ⁴ from Tonkin,
(11100111 with Aemilium repandum Willd. The contention that “Aeros-
tiehum'’ is only “Aspidium'’ with reduced fertile pinnae, appears to 1110
10 110 1101101· established than ever. Is this a step in advance in the
development or a degeneration? The example of Dryopteris canescens,
where the incontestable deformation 01 1110 1111111111 both fertile and
sterile, is accompanied by 1110 acrostichoid formation 115 10 1110 5011101005
parts, appears 10 1110 10 1101111 strongly to the latter 3 that 15 10 say,
an aberration and weakening 01 1110 type, which one ean scarcely call
only 10101010810111, because the influenees that have. caused the changes
are unknown.
OBSERVATIONS.

1. In my Filices Insularum Philippinarmn ⁵ I have noted Aspidimn
Pazon-1502· var. elatius Christ and A. ‘qrammi 110ιῖιῖ05. Both belong 111 Α thy-
riwm, with aspidioid 5011, as is the ease with Athyrinm 111-1111101101 m which
is found in the Philippines with absolutely aspidioid sori.

2. 111 1115 Polypodiaceae 01 1110 Philippine Islands,G C'opelaml includes
N epha-odium asperula-m (J. Sm.) Copel. The 51100105 was based on No.
(53 (suminy, Polypodiu-nz asperula-722. J. Sin„ and the specimen in the
Herbarimn 01 1110 Bureau 01 Science 15 10 1110 1111010101)ιά speluncae
(Linn.) Moore, with submarginal sori.

3. Gopelmzd ⁷ admits Neplzrodiam ruyuslosmn (Labill.) Copel„ but to
me the plant indicated is H ypolepis. Species 01 H ypolepis with the sori
more 01 1055 11111011101811101 give 1150 10 some doubt as to their proper ¹
disposition. There 15 a 101111 111 1110 Ρ11111111111105 which 1105 a rhizome
011011, 11 1101 always, 0100111118, which is generally a good character 01 true
Hypolepz's and which indicates the relationship 01 11101 genus with
Pteridizcm. This form was considered by me at first 05 Dryopteris
setiyera (Blmne) O. Ktz„ and later as Αερίῑῖιῖιωη vile Kunze, 01 Java,
with which it has a great resemblance. It has been collected on Mount
App, Mindanao‚ by Copelcmd (No. 1462) October, 1904, and on Mount
