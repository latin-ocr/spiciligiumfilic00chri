This essentially Chinese type, widely distributed in China and extending into
British India only in the high valleys of Bhootan. Khasia and Sikkim, appears
again in the mountains of northern Luzon with many other characteristic Chinese
plants. The specimens agree perfectly with the slightly elongated form of ('hina.

l have previously treated the polymorphism of the ,llict·o.s-01·ium¹'·' type of
which the best known representative is Ι). punctatum (L.) Sw. The present new
Torm, from its venation is almost exactly intermediate between P. punctatum Sw..
and P. myriocarpum Mett. In the former, the later-al nerves are very regular,
oblique, reaching the margin and inclosing 4 or 5 areolae. which are elongated,
rectangular, between the rachis and the margins, these areolae are about equal.
and the network of nerves is weak, inclosed in and more or less hidden by the
fleshy tissue. In P. myriocarpum on the contrary, the lateral nerves do not
reach the margin of the frond, and inclose only one large areola along the rachis
and another narrower one between it and the margin, and the veins are strong
and rather prominent. P. Sublanianum has an even more delicate texture than
P. myrioearpum, and its nerves are slender, not prominent and form a single
very large square areola, at the side of which is another very narrow obscure
one. The plant is larger, 73 cm. long, 5.5 cm. wide, the apex of the frond long
eaudate, the base long decurrent, the stipe very short. Texture membranous,
color bright green, the costa light yellow, shining, the fronds which appear to be
solitary and not fascieled have undulate. margins, the rhizome is climbing,
brown, as thick as a goose quill, covered with stiff subulate dark hrown 4 mm.

lona scales.
