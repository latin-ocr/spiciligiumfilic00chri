l have identified this plant after comparison with specinwns from the Sand-
wich lslands, leg. ‘llillcbraml and Rastia-dn, and from New Caledonia leg. Franc-
11, is the form that (fopclaml in his Polypodiaceaa= of the l'hilippines, 84, supposes
10 be the. variety bipinne!isidam of A. contimtum Kaulf.9 but it belongs evidently
in tho section with ,1. elementum.

The species of this genus often can not be determined with certainty without
utilizing the characters shown by the secondary leaves. Unfortunatcly these
secondary leaves are as yet impcrfectly known in many species, for frequently
when adult and soriferous leaves are found, the secondary leaves are not to bc
found, and without the three forms and without the certainty of their having
come from the same plant it is often difficult if not impossible to identify these
forms of Stenochlacna with trimorphous leaves

Unclerwoocl⁰ separatos the species of Stenochlacna of the Old World, which
have. the veins springing directly from the midrib‚ into two groups: l, Terat-
ophyllmn with trimorphous leaves and with spiny naked rhizomes, and 2,
Lomariopsis with rhizomes covered with scales but spineless. However, our
knowledge of the last group is not sufficiently complete to determine whether or
not the secondary leaves are present or lacking, but l am of the opinion that
they are present, at least in some species,

From the Philippines I am able to record the following speeies:

44. Stenocmaena aculeata (Blume) Kunze Bot. Zeit. 6: 142. Lomaria
aculeata Blume Enum. Pl. Jav. 205. ‚

The second-ary leaves of this plant agree very well with those figured by H ookcr
Sp. Fil. 1: 56. Β, for Davallia. ‹tehillcaefolia Wall„ which is cited by Underwoocz
as a synonym of S. (mulcant. Ι do not hesit-ate to identify with this speciesthe
form described by Uopclaud as Aspleniwn epipltyticum (Perk. Frag. Fl. Philip.
(1905) 184), and Dr. Gopclaml himself admits in his Comparative Eeology of
San Ramon Polypodiaceae,¹⁰ that this plant is “apparently identical with oceasional
immature forms of S. ‹aouleacaffl This form constitutos simply, as I have demon-
strated in Vcrhcmd. Schwciz. N at. Forsch. Ges. (1900) Tab. 5, the metamorphosis
of the second-ary leaves to the adult ones, combined with asplcnioid sori which
appear on the metamorphosed leaves as a reminder of the origin of the genus,
which is from the vicinity of Asplen‘ium. I‘have a specimen from Dr. Copeland
which has beside scolopendriform leaves, a portion of the rhizome with spines
and with tripinnate leaves similar to those figured by Hooker for Davallia
achilleaefolia.

Gopewnd found his Asplenium epipliyticum without the adult form *of Steno-
chlaena, which shows that the species of Stenochlaena are not always normally
developecL but remain sometimes in a stunted condition. An analagous ease is
found in the Philippines in Leptoohilus heteroclitus.
