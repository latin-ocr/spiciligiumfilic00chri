MINDORO, Baco River (168 McGregsor) April—May, 1905.

This is the typical form of Blume’s species, of which Ι have identical material
from Java, Tjipoes, leg. Raoiborslcft, and from Perak, leg. Hose, and differs froin
the plant of northern India (jlenisciwm lonyifrons Wall.> in its fleshy-papyraceous
texture, opaque, the areolae less numerous (8 to 12, rarely 111019) 111019 01 1955
concealed under the membranous epidermis and not costellate and prominent.
The proliferous shoots in the axils of the upper pinnae are also present in the
Philippine plant, as indicated by Blu'me in the Javan form.

Christensen in his Index Filicum unites this species, although with doubt,
with Dryopteris urophylla ,· however the proliferation in Blume’s species, and the
membraneus epiderniis covering and in part concealing the areolae sharply
distinguishes D. oztspidata from D. urophylla. D. lonyifrons differs in having 11
very smooth shining surface, the areolae in strong relies, and in the form of its
pinnae which are elongated and with their margins nearly parallel. In regard
to the elongated sori, Ι have from Java a specimen with 1119111 nearly round. It
goes without saying that diagnose's alone are of little value in indicating the
differences in forms and the slight characters that distinguish these undivided
species of Dryopteris‚· characters that strike the eye on examination of specimens
are often difficult to express in words in this and parallel cases.
