From repeated examinations of material from the Philippines I have not been
able to determine with certainty the form described by Heni-er, Synopsis 202, as
Nephrodium latipiwna, as that species is represented by specimens from Hongkong
and Tonkin (leg. Gadiere).

The Philippines share with Celebes a plurality of forms of this species, interest-
ing because of the numerous more or less “insular’' forms into which it is
divided. Ι refer the reader to what Ι have said regarding it in Ami. Jard. Bot.
Buiteowory l. e., where Ι have shown its affinity to the group containing P.
parasstica of which it appears to be a weakly derived specieS, weakly derived
because of its generally reduced dimensions, the indusium frequently lacking,
and its sori irregular, but above all in the variation in the form of the fronds
which present all forms of pinnae. from those linear and elongated to those
variously cut, lobed and dilated in a most bizarre manner, and finally in the
‹limorphism and narrowness of the fertile fronds which have much elongated
stipes and the pinnae so narrowed that the sori lose their distinctness and form
a mass which entirely covers the narrow fertile pinnae, in this latter respect
resembling those of Eycnolfia appendiculam.

In Celebes Ι have distinguished three forms—71ephrodiformis, which is scarcely
dimorphous3 yymozoyramanaides, with the fertile fronds somewhat reduced ; and
acrostichoides with the fertile pinnae narrowly linear. ‘For the species as it
occurs in the Philippines, this distinction does not suffice, and it is necessary to
distinguish a large number of forms, some of which have acquired the value of
subspecies, or perhaps in some cases, of species. These forms Ι characterize as
follows:

Var. lobaturn n. var.

Statura minore, stipite longiore (20 0111., frondis 20 cm.) pinnis minus
numerosis, latioribus, iobis latioribus, paucioribus, profundioribus nervis
flexuosis, interdum irregularibUS, aream unam costalem formantibus,
pubescentia sensiore grisea imprimis costas nervosque tegente, et soris
indusiis carentibus, saepe irregulariter elongatis.

This variety more or less resembles the large form figured by Blume and
approaches a small D. parasitica, but the stipe is relatively longer, 20 cm„ the
frond 20 cm„ the pinnae less 1100101000, longer, the lobes longer and more numerous

and more deeply divided, thenerves very undulating, forming one costal areola,
pubescent.
