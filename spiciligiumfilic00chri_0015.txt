SPIGILIGIUM rnatum PH11⁴11‘P1N101NSIUM. 165

The specimens have been referred by the collectors with doubt, sometimes
to Asplenimn hirtum Kaulf.. sometimes to A. caudatam Forst. They have more
the appearance of A. hot·¹›·'1‘clum Kauff.. but differ from the latter in being snialler‚
with shorter pinnae, the lobes less numerous, truncate at the apices, and the
stipe particularly villous 1 believe that the speciincns cited above are identical
with the species clearly described by Presl.

38. Asplenium horridum Kaulf. Enum. 173.

MINDANAO, District of Davao, Mount Apo (319 DeVore et Hoovcr) 1903.

Very typical and agreeing with specimens from the Sunda Islands and
Polynesia.

39. Asplenium militare Copel. in Philip. -Journ. Sei. 1 (1900) Suppl. 254.

MINDANAO, District of Davao, Mount Apo (321 Dcl'orc ct [loon-er) May, 1903;
(1505 Gopelmzd), 1,800 111. alt„ a specimen with more deeply lobed pinnam

A species remarkable for its resemblance to :lsplcnium serra Langsd. et Fisch..
of tropica] America, very large with broad lanceolate pinna² which are lobed and
finely denticulate, the sori short and close to the costa. ¹

40. Asplenium cuneatum Lam. Encyel. 2: 309. .

This group, difficult everywhere, is particularly polymorphous in the Philip-
pines. A form that can be admitted to the Philippine flora, without doubt, is
the following:

Var. tripinnatum Fourn. Fil. Nov. ealedon. 2307.
Tripinnatifidum, segmentis brevibus ovato-cuneatis.

MINDANAO, District of Davao, Mount Apo (318 DcVorc ct Homer) May, 1003:
Province of Zamboanga, San Ramon (1728 Gopelsmd) April, 1904, alt. 600 111.
LUZON, Province of Rizal, Montalban (Loher) March, 1906.

41. Asplenium laserpitiifolium Lam. Encycl. 2: 310.

This species in the young state is perhaps sometimes confused with the
preceding, but Fowvzier 1. c.‚ indicates a good distinctive character. In A.
cuneatum the sori are narrow, flabellate and reach to the bordei· of the pinnae,
while in A. lascrpitiifolium they are convex and are confined to the middle of the
pinnae.

LUZON, Province of Benguet. Baguio (0029 Eleatem: Province of Bataan,
Mount Mariveles (176 thiiforcl) May, 1904.

Var. subvenustum n. var.

This is a reduced form 30 to 45 cm. high with very much ‹livided fronds and
slender stipes, the pinnules 5 111111. long, sometimes longer, triangular, flabellate,
the sori small, short, two or three on a pinnule, resembling Adia‘ntum venustum
Don. The specimens are not young plants, but appear to be full grown and
constant in the above characters

LUZON‚ Province of Rizal, Bosoboso (1097 leontos) July, 19063 (80 Fooeooorthy)
January, 190οι Province of Cavite, Mendez Nusiez (1037 Mangyubat) August, 1900.

42. Asplenium affine Sw.; δώῃ-1111011111. 18002 (1801) 50.

After comparison with specimens from Bourbon and Africa, I admit to the
Philippine flora as this species, a specimen with bipinnate fronds, the pinnules
elongate·rhomboidal, 2 cm. long, linequal, irregularly (lentate, slightly ineised,
the sori numerous, straight, narrow, elongated‚ and parallel. In texture this
species is firmer than the preceding one.
