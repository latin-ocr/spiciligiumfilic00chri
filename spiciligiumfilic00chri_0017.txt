The same plant with simple leaves but with their bases cut into irregular
pinnate segments has been called by Bory, scolopendrium Dum-illei (Kunze

The specimens agree well with the description of thc speeies The secondary
leaves, which I presume belong with the specimens cited, but without being able
to determine this point with certainty, differ from those of the preceding species
in their linear, more elongated scgments and with a tendcncy of the frond to
become gradually larger and to present auricles at the anterior base of the
pinnules, a point of nnion with A-splcnium of the cuneatum group. conf. Verhamll.

LUZON, Province of Rizal, Montalban (Lohcr) ⁷January, 1906, a very similar
form, but slightly larger from the Lamao River, Province of Bataan (85 Barncs).

This species is distinguished by its very unequal and crenulate pinnae, one
specimen with secondary leaves bearing also some adult leaves, which, although
small, are strongly crenulate. The seeondary leaves arc rather large, 10 em.
long, 4 cm. wide, nearly sessile, tripinnatifid, thc rachis reddish, flexuous, the
pinnae ovate, obtuse, 2 em. long, 1 cm. wide3 the pinnules serrate, cut into linear
segments which are obtuse, often bi· or tri-furcatc, 2 111111. long, 0.5 to 1 mm.
wide, the color very dark green.

MINDANAO, District of Zamboanga, San Ramon (1749 C'opclcmcl) ‚ alt. 750 111.

Judging from the above authentic specimen this is a very distinct species,
characterized by the cartilaginous borders of the adult pinnae. ’

This is the plant described by me in Bull. Herb. Boiss. II. δ’ (1900) 997, and
which approaches S. Milnei Underw. ex deser„ bnt which it is impossible for me
to identify specifically because fertile fronds arc lacking.

Τ1115 species, found by Guminy, is cited by Gouola-ml in his Polypodiaceae of
the Philippines 54, without exact locality. It appears to bc rare. I have
specimens from Montalban‚ Province of RizaL LUZON, collected by Lohcr in
March, 1906, that agree exactly with Hoolcer’s figmre, except that Loher’s
specimens are smaller, and have bi- to tri—pinnatifid fronds instead of tri· to
quadri-pinnatifid ones.
