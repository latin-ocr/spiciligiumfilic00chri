absolute identity of the venation. tissue and its general structure. It is a
striking example of the strange and luxuriant forms found in the Philippines.

Leptoehilus lcttisolius is distinguishable from our plant by its firm texture,
not diaphanous, its color, black when dry, its proliferous fronds and its areola·
supplied with a network of very irregular nerves.

Dicl’s procedure 111 placing Hemionit'is Zollinyemi in Nysa-(lrssmntc is to me an
unnatural arranginent. The ancestry of the plant is rather in the Aspidicae,
analagous to Nrcnoscmia. and accordingly the above new generic name is proposed
for it.

The above specimens agree exactly with material from tropical America, It
is rather remarkable that this species, like Isindsaya lancea» (Linn.) Bedd.‚ should
be found in tropical America and again in the orient.

The above specimens represent the typical form of this polymorphous species,
being membr-anons in texture, the nervos manifest on the lower surfaee and not
united, the segments oblong united at the base, the stipe and rachis generally
smooth. The numerous derived forms of this group which are found in the
Philippines can be gmuped as follows:
